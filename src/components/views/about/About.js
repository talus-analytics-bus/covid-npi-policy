              The COVID Analysis and Mapping of Policies (AMP) visualization
              tool is a comprehensive database of policies and plans to address
              the COVID-19 pandemic. Decision-makers can use COVID AMPâ€™s
              user-friendly interface to easily identify effective policies and
              plans to reduce the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                COVID AMP is part of the COVID-Local suite of free resources
                developed for local decision-makers who are working to keep
                their communities safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID
                AMP library includes policies and plans published by subnational
                governments or private and non-profit organizations, in addition
                to those released by national governments.
